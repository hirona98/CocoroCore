PyInstaller
================================================================================

PyInstaller is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL-2.0)
with a special exception which allows to use PyInstaller to build and distribute
non-free programs (including commercial applications).

The full text of the exception is as follows:

"In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
not linked into a combined executable.)"

This means that programs packaged with PyInstaller can be distributed under
any license the developer chooses, without being affected by PyInstaller's GPL license.

For more information: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/COPYING.txt

================================================================================

For the most up-to-date license information for each package, please refer to
the respective project's repository or PyPI page.
